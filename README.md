the game is being hosted on nfccardwars.netlify.app and its pretty easy to make ur own cards you can use a phone (download nfc tools and then you can write the required signals) you can use a flipper zero you can use any tool that has nfc writing oh yeah and here is what you gotta do 
make a text record and write down any spells you want (easiest thing ever) for flipper zero you are gonna need an app called nfc maker (it should already be on there just go to apps then nfc and scroll down)
SPELLS remember you gotta write these words in a text record and then you can emulate (if it asks you what ntag you want any will work but ntag213 is common)
